### Key Dependencies & Rationale

- **`convex` & `@convex-dev/react`**: Chosen for its seamless real-time data synchronization capabilities. Convex eliminates the need for complex state management by providing automatic reactivity and real-time updates across all connected clients. The built-in authentication, cron jobs, and serverless functions make it ideal for a lead generation platform requiring automated workflows.

- **`recharts`**: Selected for its rich ecosystem of customizable charting components. Unlike other charting libraries, Recharts provides excellent TypeScript support, responsive design capabilities, and smooth animations that align with the dashboard's modern aesthetic. It enables complex data visualizations like trend analysis, score distributions, and interactive filtering.

- **`framer-motion` via `motion/react`**: Used to create a polished, app-like experience with smooth animations and micro-interactions. The newer `motion/react` import provides better tree-shaking and performance. Animations are carefully orchestrated to provide visual feedback, guide user attention, and create delightful transitions between states.

- **`shadcn/ui` & `@radix-ui/*`**: These component libraries provide a robust foundation for building accessible, customizable UI components. Radix UI handles complex accessibility patterns, while shadcn/ui provides beautiful styling that can be easily customized with Tailwind CSS. This combination ensures both excellent UX and developer productivity.

- **`sonner`**: Implemented for comprehensive user feedback through toast notifications. Unlike basic notification systems, Sonner provides contextual, actionable feedback with custom styling that matches the design system. It ensures users receive immediate feedback for all actions, from successful operations to detailed error messages.

- **`@ai-sdk/anthropic` & `ai`**: Integrated for AI-powered lead scoring and analysis. The Vercel AI SDK provides a unified interface for working with multiple AI providers, while Anthropic's Claude provides sophisticated reasoning capabilities for evaluating company data and generating lead scores based on strategic criteria.

### Project Configuration & Developer Experience

The initial project scaffold was enhanced with careful attention to developer experience and code quality:

- **TypeScript (`tsconfig.json`):** Configured with strict type checking, path mapping for clean imports (`@/components`, `@/convex`), and optimized for Next.js App Router. This prevents runtime errors and improves IDE support throughout the development process.

- **Next.js (`next.config.mjs`):** Optimized for performance with Turbopack enabled in development for faster builds. Image optimization is configured for external sources like LinkedIn profile images, ensuring fast loading times while maintaining visual quality.

- **Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.ts`):** Extended with a comprehensive design system including custom color palettes, typography scales, spacing systems, and animation keyframes. The configuration supports both light and dark themes with CSS variables, ensuring consistent visual hierarchy across all components.

- **Vitest (`vitest.config.ts`):** Configured for comprehensive testing with Node.js environment, path aliases matching the main project, and coverage reporting. Tests are organized by feature area with setup files for common mocking patterns.

### Design System & Styling Architecture

A deliberate and scalable styling architecture was established to ensure design consistency and maintainability across the entire application.

- **Foundation in `globals.css`:** Instead of relying solely on Tailwind's defaults, we established foundational design tokens as CSS variables. This includes a complete color system supporting both light and dark modes, chart color palettes for data visualization, and custom animation keyframes for micro-interactions.

- **Custom Animation System:** Built a comprehensive animation library including:

  - `fadeUp` animations for widget reveals with staggered timing
  - `cross-fade-and-scale` for smooth state transitions
  - `logoFade` sequences for branding moments
  - `bounce-in` and `wiggle-once` for delightful micro-interactions
  - All animations use `ease-out` timing for natural, responsive feel

- **Responsive Design Patterns:** The dashboard implements a mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific layouts. However, the core dashboard experience is optimized for desktop (1280px+) with a graceful fallback message for smaller screens, ensuring the complex data visualizations remain readable and interactive.

- **Component Styling Strategy:** Components use a combination of Tailwind utilities and CSS variables, allowing for easy theming and consistent spacing. Interactive elements follow a unified hover and focus pattern with `scale(1.05)` transforms and backdrop-blur effects for depth.

## Design Philosophy & Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

The user experience was guided by three core HCI principles: **Clarity, Efficiency, and Intelligence**

- **Clarity (Progressive Data Disclosure):** The dashboard avoids overwhelming users with raw data dumps. Instead, it uses a layered approach where high-level metrics are immediately visible, with drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis. Charts use consistent color coding, clear legends, and contextual tooltips to make complex data relationships understandable at a glance.

- **Efficiency (Keyboard-First Navigation):** The interface prioritizes power users with comprehensive keyboard shortcuts (`⌘K` for command palette, `⌘1-3` for quick navigation, `⌘\` for theme toggle). The command palette provides fuzzy search across all actions, and the dock provides persistent access to core functions. This reduces cognitive load and enables rapid workflow execution.

- **Intelligence (Contextual Automation):** The system learns from user patterns and provides intelligent defaults. Lead scoring happens automatically in the background, search suggestions adapt based on existing data, and the automation system discovers new leads matching user criteria. Error handling is contextual and actionable, guiding users toward resolution rather than just reporting problems.

## Real-time Data Architecture with Convex

The backbone of Personal Project Radar is its sophisticated real-time data architecture built on Convex, enabling live updates, automated workflows, and intelligent data processing.

### Convex Schema Design

The database schema is carefully designed to support both real-time querying and complex analytics:

```typescript
// Core entities optimized for TanStack Table integration
companies: defineTable({
  company_name: v.string(),
  website: v.string(),
  lead_score: v.optional(v.number()),
  arpu_band: v.optional(v.string()),
  key_signals: v.optional(v.array(v.string())),
  // ... extensive fields for comprehensive lead tracking
})
  .index("by_lead_score", ["lead_score"])
  .index("by_website", ["website"]);

// Raw enrichment data for audit trail and reprocessing
raw_enrichment: defineTable({
  company_id: v.id("companies"),
  source: v.string(), // 'exa_website', 'linkedin', 'crunchbase', etc.
  json_payload: v.string(),
  fetched_at: v.number(),
}).index("by_company", ["company_id"]);

// Automated discovery queue for batch processing
discovery_queue: defineTable({
  domain: v.string(),
  status: v.string(), // 'pending', 'processing', 'completed'
  scheduled_for: v.number(),
  attempts: v.number(),
  priority: v.optional(v.number()),
});
```

### Automated Cron Jobs & Background Processing

The system implements five automated cron jobs for continuous lead generation and maintenance:

1. **Daily Lead Discovery (9:00 AM UTC):** Automatically discovers new companies matching ICP criteria using advanced search algorithms and adds them to the processing queue.

2. **Hourly Queue Processing (:15 minutes):** Processes pending companies in the discovery queue, performing comprehensive enrichment from multiple data sources in parallel.

3. **Weekly Score Refresh (Monday 8:00 AM UTC):** Re-scores existing leads with updated AI models and market data, ensuring scoring accuracy improves over time.

4. **Daily Cleanup (2:00 AM UTC):** Optimizes database performance by cleaning old logs, compressing historical data, and maintaining search indexes.

5. **Health Check (Every 2 hours):** Monitors system performance, API rate limits, and data quality, with automatic alerting for issues requiring attention.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern for API Resilience

To ensure system reliability during external API outages, we implemented a sophisticated circuit breaker pattern for Anthropic API calls:

```typescript
class AnthropicCircuitBreaker {
  private failures = 0;
  private readonly failureThreshold = 5;
  private readonly recoveryTimeout = 300000; // 5 minutes

  isOpen(): boolean {
    // Prevents API calls during outages
  }

  recordSuccess(): void {
    // Gradually reopens circuit after successful calls
  }

  recordFailure(): void {
    // Tracks failures and opens circuit when threshold reached
  }
}
```

This pattern prevents cascading failures and provides graceful degradation when external services are unavailable.

## Advanced Testing Infrastructure

The project implements comprehensive testing coverage using Vitest with specialized testing patterns for different system components.

### Test Organization & Coverage

- **`tests/automation.test.ts`**: Tests all cron job functions, queue processing logic, and error handling scenarios
- **`tests/scoring.test.ts`**: Validates AI scoring algorithms, circuit breaker functionality, and score calculation accuracy
- **`tests/search.test.ts`**: Covers search functionality, duplicate detection, and company enrichment workflows
- **`tests/setup.ts`**: Configures test environment with mocks for external APIs and Convex runtime

### Testing Patterns & Strategies

```typescript
// Example: Testing circuit breaker resilience
describe("Circuit Breaker Functionality", () => {
  it("should open circuit after consecutive failures", async () => {
    // Simulate API failures
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      await expect(scoreLead({ companyId })).rejects.toThrow();
    }

    // Verify circuit is open
    expect(anthropicCircuitBreaker.isOpen()).toBe(true);
  });
});

// Example: Testing real-time data synchronization
describe("Real-time Updates", () => {
  it("should propagate lead score changes to all connected clients", async () => {
    const company = await createTestCompany();
    const scoreUpdate = await updateLeadScore(company._id, 85);

    // Verify dashboard queries reflect changes immediately
    const dashboardData = await getDashboardSummary();
    expect(dashboardData.averageScore).toInclude(scoreUpdate);
  });
});
```

The test suite achieves high coverage across critical paths while using realistic data patterns and edge cases.

## Why All Convex Calls are Server-Side (No Client-Side Fetching)

Even though the app provides a SPA-style experience, every database interaction happens in React Server Components or Convex actions/queries, never directly in browser JavaScript. This architectural decision provides several critical advantages:

1. **Enhanced Security Posture** – By keeping all data operations server-side, we prevent exposure of sensitive database queries and business logic. Client-side code cannot be reverse-engineered to understand our lead scoring algorithms or data sources.

2. **Optimized Performance** – Server-side rendering with Convex's real-time subscriptions provides the best of both worlds: fast initial page loads with live updates. The dashboard feels instant because data is pre-rendered on the server and then enhanced with real-time subscriptions.

3. **Simplified Error Handling** – All database operations resolve once on the server, providing clean success/failure states that feed into our comprehensive toast notification system. This eliminates the need to handle complex retry logic and network states in the browser.

4. **Future-Proof Architecture** – As the platform scales, we can easily add authentication, role-based access control, and advanced caching strategies without rewriting client-side data access patterns.

5. **Reduced Bundle Size** – By keeping data access server-side, we avoid shipping database query logic and API keys to the browser, resulting in smaller JavaScript bundles and faster load times.

In summary, server-side data access keeps the application secure, performant, and maintainable while providing the real-time experience users expect from a modern dashboard.

## Command Palette & Keyboard-First Navigation

Personal Project Radar implements a sophisticated command palette system inspired by modern development tools like VS Code and Linear, providing power users with lightning-fast navigation and action execution.

- **`⌘2`**: Open search drawer for company research
- **`⌘3`**: Open Lead Radar for pipeline management
- **`⌘\`**: Toggle between light and dark themes
- **`Escape`**: Context-sensitive close (command palette, drawers, modals)

### Command Palette Features

The command palette provides a unified interface for all application actions:

```typescript
// Intelligent command filtering with keyword matching
filter={(value, search, keywords) => {
  const extendValue = value + " " + (keywords?.join(" ") || "");
  return extendValue.toLowerCase().includes(search.toLowerCase()) ? 1 : 0;
}}
```

**Key Features:**

- **Visual Cues:** Consistent iconography and spacing guide users toward efficient interaction patterns

This keyboard-first approach reduces cognitive load for power users while remaining accessible to all interaction preferences.

## AI-Powered Lead Scoring & Strategic Pipeline Valuation

Personal Project Radar implements a sophisticated, multi-factor lead scoring system inspired by enterprise B2B platforms like Nivoda's jewelry marketplace. This system transforms traditional pipeline management from static reporting into predictive, data-driven revenue forecasting.

### Strategic Scoring Framework

The scoring system moves beyond basic demographic data to create a comprehensive "Customer Health Score" that predicts both conversion likelihood and expansion revenue potential. This approach recognizes that in B2B environments, the most valuable insights come from behavioral patterns and strategic integration depth rather than simple firmographic data.

### Multi-Source Data Integration

The AI scoring engine ingests data from multiple platform touchpoints to build a holistic view of each lead:

**Firmographic Intelligence:**

- Company size, industry vertical, and geographic market
- Technology stack indicators and API integration capability
- Financial health signals from public and proprietary sources

**Engagement Behavioral Patterns:**

- Platform usage frequency and session depth
- Search specificity and filter usage patterns
- Content consumption and feature adoption rates
- Response patterns to outreach and marketing campaigns

**Transactional Sophistication:**

- Average order value trends and purchase frequency
- Product mix diversity and category expansion
- Payment method preferences and credit utilization
- Return rates and customer satisfaction indicators

**Strategic Integration Depth:**

- API integration status and usage patterns
- Advanced feature adoption (automation, reporting, integrations)
- Multi-user account setup and team collaboration patterns
- Long-term contract commitments and expansion discussions

### Dynamic Weighted Scoring Matrix

The system employs a sophisticated weighted scoring approach that adapts based on the lead's current pipeline stage and historical performance data:

```typescript
// Strategic Scoring Algorithm
interface LeadScoringFactors {
  // High-impact strategic indicators (25-40% weight)
  apiIntegrationDepth: number; // 0-40 points
  platformStickiness: number; // 0-35 points
  technicalSophistication: number; // 0-30 points

  // Financial health & scale (15-25% weight)
  revenueIndicators: number; // 0-25 points
  growthTrajectory: number; // 0-20 points
  creditworthiness: number; // 0-15 points

  // Market position & expansion (10-20% weight)
  marketPresence: number; // 0-20 points
  competitivePosition: number; // 0-15 points
  geographicReach: number; // 0-10 points

  // Risk factors (negative weights -5% to -15%)
  churnRisk: number; // -15 to 0 points
  supportBurden: number; // -10 to 0 points
  paymentIssues: number; // -20 to 0 points
}

function calculateLeadScore(factors: LeadScoringFactors): number {
  const strategicScore =
    factors.apiIntegrationDepth * 0.4 +
    factors.platformStickiness * 0.35 +
    factors.technicalSophistication * 0.25;

  const financialScore =
    factors.revenueIndicators * 0.4 +
    factors.growthTrajectory * 0.35 +
    factors.creditworthiness * 0.25;

  const marketScore =
    factors.marketPresence * 0.5 +
    factors.competitivePosition * 0.3 +
    factors.geographicReach * 0.2;

  const riskPenalty =
    factors.churnRisk + factors.supportBurden + factors.paymentIssues;

  return Math.max(
    0,
    Math.min(
      100,
      strategicScore * 0.35 +
        financialScore * 0.25 +
        marketScore * 0.15 +
        riskPenalty
    )
  );
}
```

### Advanced Pipeline Valuation Model

Traditional pipeline calculations use simple formulas like `Pipeline Value = Number of deals × Average deal size`. Our system implements a sophisticated weighted model that accounts for varying conversion probabilities and customer lifetime value potential:

**Account Pipeline Valuation:**

```typescript
// Weighted pipeline value calculation
const accountPipelineValue = accounts.reduce((total, account) => {
  const projectedAnnualValue = calculateProjectedARPU(account);
  const stageConversionRate = getStageConversionRate(account.stage);
  const scoringMultiplier = getScoreMultiplier(account.leadScore);

  return total + projectedAnnualValue * stageConversionRate * scoringMultiplier;
}, 0);
```

**Dynamic Conversion Probabilities by Stage:**

| Pipeline Stage               | Base Conversion Rate | Score-Based Multiplier | Weighted Value Formula                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Marketing Qualified Lead** | 25%                  | 0.5 - 1.5x             | Estimated ARPU × 0.25 × Score Multiplier |
| **Sales Qualified Lead**     | 45%                  | 0.7 - 1.8x             | Estimated ARPU × 0.45 × Score Multiplier |
| **Technical Evaluation**     | 65%                  | 0.8 - 2.0x             | Estimated ARPU × 0.65 × Score Multiplier |
| **Commercial Negotiation**   | 80%                  | 0.9 - 2.2x             | Estimated ARPU × 0.80 × Score Multiplier |
| **Contract Pending**         | 95%                  | 0.95 - 1.1x            | Estimated ARPU × 0.95 × Score Multiplier |

### Real-Time Score Updates & Event-Driven Architecture

The scoring system operates on an event-driven architecture, automatically recalculating scores when significant business events occur:

```typescript
// Event-driven scoring updates
interface ScoringEvent {
  type:
    | "api_integration"
    | "large_transaction"
    | "feature_adoption"
    | "support_ticket";
  accountId: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  timestamp: number;
}

async function handleScoringEvent(event: ScoringEvent) {
  // Fetch current account data
  const account = await getAccountData(event.accountId);
  const historicalData = await getAccountHistory(event.accountId);

  // Recalculate score using updated data
  const newScore = await calculateLeadScore({
    ...account,
    ...processEventData(event, historicalData),
  });

  // Update score and trigger downstream actions
  await updateAccountScore(event.accountId, newScore);
  await triggerPipelineRevaluation(event.accountId);
  await notifyAccountManager(event.accountId, newScore);
}
```

### Predictive Analytics & Expansion Revenue Forecasting

The system extends beyond initial conversion to predict expansion revenue opportunities:

**Expansion Indicators:**

- **Usage Growth Patterns:** Tracking API call volume, feature adoption velocity, and user seat expansion
