# Search Functionality Restoration Summary

## ðŸŽ‰ Successfully Re-enabled Search & Add Company Feature

### What Was Fixed

#### 1. **Resolved Circular Dependencies in `convex/search.ts`**

- **Problem**: The search module had circular dependencies with the enrichment module
- **Solution**:
  - Moved all functions to be defined before usage
  - Used proper internal function references via `internal.search.*`
  - Separated internal and public functions clearly

#### 2. **Fixed Schema Mismatches**

- **Companies Table**:
  - Removed non-existent fields (`domain`, `created_at`, `updated_at`)
  - Used existing fields from schema
- **Event Log**:
  - Changed `event_data` to `metadata` (correct field name)
  - Removed `timestamp` (not in schema)
- **Discovery Queue**:
  - Used `domain` instead of `company_id` (correct field)
  - Used proper index `by_domain` instead of non-existent `by_company`
  - Added required fields: `scheduled_for`, `attempts`

#### 3. **Proper TypeScript Types**

- Added explicit return types to avoid circular type inference
- Used `any` type temporarily for complex filter operations
- Fixed all implicit type errors

### Re-enabled Features

âœ… **Company Research Page** (`CompanyResearchHome.tsx`)

- "Add to Lead Radar" button now functional
- Companies are added to database with enrichment queued

âœ… **Search Drawer** (`SearchDrawer.tsx`)

- Manual company addition works
- Proper success/duplicate notifications

âœ… **Phase 6 Dashboard** (`Phase6TestDashboard.tsx`)

- Test search functionality restored
- Integration with search module working

### How It Works Now

1. **User adds a company** â†’ `searchAndAddCompany` action is called
2. **Check for existing** â†’ Internal mutation checks if company exists by website
3. **Create if new** â†’ Company record created in database
4. **Queue enrichment** â†’ Added to `discovery_queue` for processing
5. **User feedback** â†’ Toast notifications for success/duplicate

### Backend Architecture

```typescript
// Clean separation of concerns
- createCompany (internal mutation) - Creates company records
- addToDiscoveryQueue (internal mutation) - Queues for enrichment
- searchAndAddCompany (public action) - Main entry point
- searchExistingCompanies (public query) - Search existing companies
- getSearchSuggestions (public action) - Autocomplete suggestions
```

### Next Steps

The search functionality is now fully operational and companies can be:

1. Added to the database
2. Queued for enrichment
3. Tracked in the discovery queue
4. Processed by the Phase 7 automation system

The enrichment pipeline will process queued companies via the cron jobs we set up in Phase 7.
